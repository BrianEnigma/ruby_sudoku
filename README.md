#Daily Sudoku Downloader

This little Ruby script will scrape the New York Times and USA Today sites for the current daily sudoku puzzle.  It grabs the difficult one from NYT.  There is only one puzzle for USA Today.  It will download the puzzle, locally caching it, and generate a PDF of the two puzzles together.

The resulting PDF contains the two puzzles, each in a 3" x 5" square, so it can be folded up into a double-sided square that is suitable for your Hipster PDA, Field Notes, or Moleskine Cahier.

This script is suitable for wrapping up in a daily cron job.
